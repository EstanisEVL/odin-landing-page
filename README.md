In this project, I will be creating an entire web page from a design provided by TOP.

The design provided came in the form of 2 images: one is an image of the complete website, and the other has some details about some of the fonts and colors used.

The point of this assignment is to create something from scratch and get the various elements in more or less the right position relative to the rest.

Skills demonstrated once completed the project:

- CSS foundations

selectors (classes)
properties
box model

- Flexbox

flex (grow, shrink and basis)
flex directions
flex alignment
